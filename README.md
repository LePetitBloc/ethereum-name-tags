## Description
Before the creation of the [Ethereum name service](https://ens.domains/)
there were no official way to identify the ownership of an Ethereum address.

Etherscan provided a **name tag**, to help Ethereum users differentiate
important addresses from others and also reassure a user when sending
values a known address.
